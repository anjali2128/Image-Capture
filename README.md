# 📸 Image Capture using OpenCV

A simple Python script that captures images from your webcam using **OpenCV**.  
This project demonstrates how to access a live camera feed, display the video stream, and save snapshots on key press.

## 🚀 Features
- Live camera preview using OpenCV
- Capture and save images with one key press
- Simple and lightweight script (`camera_capture.py`)
- Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux

## 🧠 How It Works
The script uses your system's webcam to continuously capture frames.  
When you press a specific key (e.g., `s`), it saves the current frame as an image file.
